# Overview

Here, we will give a brief overview of the core concepts of how Vivid works, ways to fully use its potential, and how to customize it to your needs.

## How Vivid works & why?

Vivid is a [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) application. It uses [React](https://reactjs.org/) as a view layer, [Mantine](https://mantine.dev/) as a UI framework, and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) as a utility-first CSS framework.

This means that Vivid is a single-page application (SPA) that is rendered on the client-side. It is not a static site generator (SSG) like [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), and it is not a server-side rendered (SSR) application like [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/) or [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

We build Vivid as an alternative to the expensive nature of admin templates. We wanted to create a tool that is easy to use, easy to customize, and easy to maintain. We also wanted to make it as fast as possible.

## How it compares to other tools?

While Vivid doesn't bring entire backend solutions like [Forest Admin](https://www.forestadmin.com/) or [Supabase](https://supabase.io/), it is a great tool to build admin panels for your existing backend solutions.

Our target audience is developers who want to build admin panels for their existing backend. We don't want to reinvent the wheel, and we don't want to lock you into our ecosystem. We want to give you a tool that you can use to build your admin panels, and we want to give you the freedom to use it however you want while being free & open-sourced.

As Vivid is a Vite application, you can build and integrate it into your existing backend. You can also deploy it to any static hosting provider like [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) or [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
